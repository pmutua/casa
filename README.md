Real Estate Assistant chatbot developed using [RASA](https://rasa.com/)

👋 Welcome to the 🤖 "CASA" (Chatbot Assistant for Smart Agents) wiki!

This wiki contains walking you through the process of creating a functional chatbot using the open-source conversational AI framework Rasa. We'll start by setting up the development environment and installing Rasa, then move on to defining intents and entities, building the dialogue flow, integrating the chatbot with different channels, and finally deploying the chatbot. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a working chatbot that you can customize to your own needs. So, sit back, grab a cup of coffee and let's get started.
